**For game**: [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com)

**Description:**
This modlet hides the Day and Time info from you in the UI...on the map and compass.
this info can still be seen at traders and on the tips/help area.

NOTE: There is some commented out lines in the windows.xml file and instructions on what to change if
you want to just have the juse the time OR day displayed.

Why?
- More "immersion" due to a cleaner UI
- More "immersion" as you will not have this info readily available to perfectly time events in advance.
- To more easily allow other mods to provide time info for you (adding watches/clocks/etc.)
