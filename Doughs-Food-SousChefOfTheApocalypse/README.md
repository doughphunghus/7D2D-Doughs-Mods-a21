**For game**: [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com)

**Description:**
This modlet adds new food items and recipes.
Purposefully not including any new icons/models so its server side safe BUT:

**Note**: This mod is intended to be the initial "Food Expansion Pack" to "Doughs-You've Got Mail", and both can be installed together or separately. Additional "story" for this will come at some other time. Maybe. Eventually they may both be merged together.

**Note**: there ARE some plants that are required to spawn (for secondary challenges) so if another mod makes biome changes, or you play a game with fewer than "all" biomes, you may have issues with some of the secondary challenges (because the plants may not spawn/exist).

**Note**: NONE of the foods or ingredients should be too OP compared to vanilla foods. This is a crafting and "for fun" mod not to turn you into Rambo by eating bon bons.

**Note**: The "Primary challenge" of the a20 version is to craft the Egg Souffle. In a21 there are several "Secondary Challenges" that result in special dishes or food items (and craftable gift boxes) that should be somewhat difficult to craft in a single player game (due to rare ingredients). 

**Note**: Some items can be found in containers or bought at traders (rarely, and never in large quantities). Item semi-rarity is hopefully a norm as you are supposed to be cooking and preparing, not buying and finding! a21 note: ok, some things have to be found/looted, but nothing that stops you from making the Egg Souffle.

**a20**: It includes (a20 original items):
- New perk: Sous Chef of the Apocalypse.  Works similar to vanilla perk Master Chef but with its own special foods and (in a21) crafting magazines.
- 4 Cookbooks to unlock special foods/ingredients
- 55+ Food/drink items (either found/crafted/perk unlock/or crafting magazine) in the main "craft trees".

The foods/items in the main/original a20 crafting trees are:
- 13 moldy/old foods that can be only looted (and eaten if starving) or sometimes processed into 'scraps' these scraps can also be eaten or made into a soup: Mulligan Au Jus
- Toasted Pumpkin, Pine, and Acorn seeds
- Cooking Oil
- Bouillon Cube
- Sauteed Mushrooms
- Flour
- Red Wine
- Sweet and Salty Extracts
- Cream Of Tartar
- Hard Tack
- Beef Jerky
- Pemmican
- Bone Marrow
- Raw and boiled Sweet Bread
- Sweet Bread Cuisine
- Steak And Potato Cuisine
- Au Jus
- Beef Au Jus Sandwich
- Pop Corn
- Milk Curds
- Raw Milk, Milk, and Cream
- Cheese
- Butter
- Butter Of The Gods
- Bread Batter
- Bread
- Buttered Toast
- Sweet Corn Blueberry Muffin
- Ice Cream
- Red Wine Blueberry Sorbet
- Turkish Delight
- Sweet Nut Milk
- Egg Souffle
- Potatoes Dauphinoise
- Boeuf Bourguignon
- Croque Monsieur

**a21**: Added for a21: (not listing everything purposefully):
- A handful of more items/foods
- Some rebalancing of ingredient counts, and "game economy".
- 1 Food Dehydrator: for making jerkies and some items/ingredients.
NOTE: puts out a little "heat" like dew collector (purposeful as they are air drying meats/food), and drying times are high on purpose. Early survival crafting, like if you simply cannot find a cooking pot, but some items are only made in it.
- 2 Hydroponics stations to grow a few special plant ingredients you may raely find. These stations are for slowly growing them so you don't have to always loot them.
NOTE: Puts out a little "heat" like dew collector (purposeful as they are full of lights), and the text "Dew Collector" is in these as its a pain to mod out (sorry!). Growing time is slow on purpose.
- "Gift Bundles": These are mostly symbolic. For giving to friends, newbies?, and mostly to prove to yourself you crafted everything to make the gift.
- 2 treasure maps. Because why not? 1 has a better chance of having decent sous chef items.
- A few "hidden" things to loot for special dishes. Mostly for the challenge of them. There ARE some clues if you read sous chef related book/item/block? descriptions, game tips, etc.(I forget where they all are!).
- A few very small and pointless surprises? Probably not. Simmer down.
