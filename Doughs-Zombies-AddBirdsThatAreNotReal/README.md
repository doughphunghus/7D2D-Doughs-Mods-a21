**For game**: [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com)

**Description:**
This mod just adds some zeds (1 currently, that is a vanilla vulture skinned) that attack you differently than the vanilla vulture buy shooting darts. They also move faster and make non vulture noises so you can iudentify them as different.

Since tehy are robots/drones internally, Harvesting them can yield steel, robotic parts, motion sensors.

They spawn (hopefully sparingly) in several places, usually when/where vultures can spawn. Also: they probably will not appear much in early hordes/early gamestages.

WHY?: To add server side variety to flying zeds. To do something different.
