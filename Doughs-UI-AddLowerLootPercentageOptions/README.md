**For game**: [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com)

**Description:**
This modlet adds a few more options to the "Loot Abundance" selector (in the advanced section) at the game start menu.

New options for Loot: 2%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%

Why?
- Stretch out the early game, as looting will be less effective.
- Make looting more difficult (perks will help, obviously, but those come later game) so you will have to rely on crafting/harvesting/trading more.
