**For game**: [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com)

**Description:**
a21: You MUST edit this mod and uncomment the tooltips you want removed!
a20: The "You are wet" tooltip was uncommented by default.

If you uncomment them:Removes environmental related tooltips (hot/cold/wet) from appearing at the bottom of the screen.

This is a template mod giving examples so you can more easily determine if you want to add other tooltips to remove

Why?
- Was a request from a comment on the 7daystodiemods.com site
- Some tooltips pop up frequently and this is an example mod that removes some of them, and can be used as a template to remove more is you wish.
