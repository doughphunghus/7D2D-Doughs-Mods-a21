**For game**: [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com)

**Description:**
This mod just adds so some zeds (1 currently, that is a vanilla spider) that should jump *much* further (and maybe higher as well?) than the vanilla ones.

Currently the ONLY *may* spawn during Horde night. Also: they probably will not appear much in early hordes/early gamestages

WHY?: Hopefully to get up/over walls/chasms and places normally the vanilla zeds do not get to. To do something different, and server side safe.
