NOTE: Special thanks to "Cranberry Monster": https://community.7daystodie.com/profile/78257-cranberry-monster/ for teh corpse block -> turn to block XML and ideas about blocks to drop!

This modlet adds a few server side "additional varients" of existing zombies.  These zombies drop a corpse on death, and this corpse quickly turns into a block.

Currently the ONLY *may* spawn during Horde night and can be identified by the fact they crawl vs walk (the spider walks as it usually crawls).
Also: they probably will not appear much in early hordes/early gamestages

The zombies : their name => the block they drop:

zombieUtilityWorker : Oswald => "organic dirt" (allows walking on/up it, can block openings/paths). This is "organic" terrain that yields "goo" when mined, and a throwable pipe bomb can be made with it to easier? destroy organic blocks if they build up in an area.

zombieBurnt: Matilda => ember pile (can burn if walked on)

zombieMaleHazmat: Charlotte => gas barrel (can explode if shot/hit, but can wrench/use tools on it to break it down)

zombieSpider : Margaret => Drops a candy tin mine you can pick up. (can explode if shot/hit)

NOTE: There are Feral and Radiated versions of thse zombies in the mod. They may have more heath but drop the same exact items as the regular ones.
