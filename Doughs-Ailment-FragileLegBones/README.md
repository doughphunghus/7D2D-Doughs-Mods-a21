**For game**: [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com)

**Description:**
Adds a *significantly* higher chance of receiving fall damage, so falling from lower heights can cause sprains and breaks.
Also: Any perk that mentions specific heights (like "can fall from 12 m...") from falling will be wrong by about the height by 4 meters

All the mods/candies/buffs that are for helping for fall damage should still work


The XML dev notes in a20 indicate: 
(vanilla) 6m falling is safe, and the "chance" of getting hurt goes up a certain percentage every meter falling.
6m is about 19.5 feet, which seems a bit high for me.

This mod essentially subtracts 4 meters from that (13 feet) so a "safe" fall is about 2 meters (6.5 feet) which is 2-3 blocks (practically).
Falling from > 3 blocks with no falling buffs is a higher chance of sprain/break as the fall damage "starting point" has been dropped so much.
From some testing: With this mod a 4 block fall is unlikely to hurt you (but can) and a > 4 block fall is very likely to hurt you)

Why?
- Noticed a lot of just jumping off of high places (like roofs of houses) and not really being punished.  If you're going to hide on a roof of a house
you should not be able to stand and jump far down onto teh ground/concrete (as an adult) without very high consequence of leg sprain/break. 
Make some stairs or something to jump down incrementally on or use things that give buffs if you're going to be high above ground.
