**For game**: [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com)

**Description:**
This modlet adds some client side icons for the mod: Doughs-Food-SousChefOfTheApocalypse
(which is an XML only server side safe mod and does not contain custom icons).
This mod, containing icons, is not server side safe.

This mod was made so as to still allow the Doughs-Food-SousChefOfTheApocalypse mod
to be server side safe, but to give the option of adding the icons if you wish to
in single player, with friends, or if the server decides to require it as a mod.

**Requirements:**
Doughs-Food-SousChefOfTheApocalypse must be loaded for this mod to work.

**NOTES:**
If joining a server, and the server does not have this mod, the icons
will not show if you have this mod loaded (like every non server side safe mod)
