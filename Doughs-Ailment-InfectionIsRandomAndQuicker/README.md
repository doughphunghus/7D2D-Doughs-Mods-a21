**For game**: [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com)

**Description:**
This modlet makes infections much more deadly by taking less time to reach 100%, and being randomly rolled each time you get infected.


The vanilla game (in a19) takes approx 7 hours [real time] for an untreated infection to reach 100%.


This mod changes that to 3 hours (max allowed real time) and adds an element of randomness so each time you get infected so you may have a chance of having less time to treat the infection.


The odds of "time left" [real time, not game time] once you are infected, are currently:

| % Chance | Time [real time, not game time] to 100% infection if untreated |
| :------------ | :------------- |
| %15 | 3 hours |
| %20 | 2 hours |
| %25 | 1.5 hours |
| %25 | 1 hour |
| %10 | 45 minutes |
| %5 | 30 minutes |


Why?
- Increase game difficulty.
- More immersion. You never know how badly you are infected until you are scratched :) Maybe it was a deep scratch, maybe it was a mutant strain, who knows.
- More incentive to not get touched by zombies.
- More incentive to not ignore infections. You may have to carry antibiotics at all times, or run back to your base/trader/other players immediately to get some.
- An untreated infection during a horde night or early game where you cannot loot or barter/trade can easily prove fatal.
