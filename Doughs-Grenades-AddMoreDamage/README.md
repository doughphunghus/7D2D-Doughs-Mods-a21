**For game**: [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com)

**Description:**
This modlet adds 2 extra grenade types that are unlocked the same way as the vanilla grenades:
- 1 steel timed grenade
- 1 steel contact grenade

These grenades:
- Can be very dangerous to use and cause block damage and destruction (earth -> wood -> stone -> metal, in that order of destructive potential), unlike vanilla grenades.
- Are not as powerful as vanilla TNT.
- Have an extra layer of steel, so they are heavier and harder to throw.
- Can be crafted, looted, or bought from traders.
