**Description**
This modlet blocks more slots in the backpack so that you have only 12 unblocked slots to start with.
Does not change the number of slots available.

**Details**:
- Why? Because you skipped leg day.
- Adding the "Triple Pocket Mod" to all armor pieces will AND fully maxing out the "Pack Mule" perk will unblock all slots.
- Note: Taking steroids will unblock all slots temporarily, per normal vanilla configs.
