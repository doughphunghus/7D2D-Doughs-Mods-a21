**For game**: [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com)

**Description:**
This modlet adds more pipe bombs AND does some rebalancing of the vanilla (iron pipe) pipe bomb to add more power so there is some progression/balance for crafting these items as the iron one is now lower tier than steel.

This modlet adds 3 extra pipe bombs that are unlocked the same way as the vanilla one:
- 1 steel: most powerful
- 1 brass: about the same power as iron
- 1 plastic: least powerful

These:
- Can be very dangerous to use and cause block damage and destruction (earth -> wood -> stone -> metal, in that order of destructive potential), unlike the vanilla pipe bomb.
- Are not as powerful as vanilla TNT.
- Will have various throwing weight, as they are all made from different materials. plastic is lightest, steel heaviest (its a thick steel?)
- Can be crafted, looted, or bought from traders.
