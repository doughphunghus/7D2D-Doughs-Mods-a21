NOTES: 
- Setting toplevel spectrums only, leaving weather related ones alone.. why? usually its raining or snowing
so precipitation... clears up the dirt/smoke a bit while its happening?
- Not sure if particle effects being set ( like smoke" on top of the burnt forest spectrum) will be too much
OR if snowing and other stuff messes things up.. but for now wait until people notice edge cases like x weather in y biome while 
z happens makes the sky weird/off/too much. too much to test every combination easily.

Since you are underwater... cannot see the sky.

wasteland default is the burnt_forest spectrum

Default spectrum not exists BUT the smokestorm effect is set at 7... hmmm
maybe the spectrum is already burnt_forest?
