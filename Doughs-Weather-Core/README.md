**For game**: [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com)

**Description:**
This modlet makes the weather more challenging to deal with BUT does not add effects to the player beyond what teh game normally adds. It adds "more bad weather" and "lower visibility" not "player debuffs/afflictions.
It makes the assumption that the apocalypse recently occurred and the air is very dirty.
The winds of nuclear annihilation have not calmed....or something like that.

It includes:
- Lots of wind will make you want to want to be inside.
- A very low chances of having "remotely nice" weather.
- High chance of rain.
- More variations in temperature, so clothing will matter more.

**Note**: 
The dense "smoke/sand/fog" particle effects are in every biome (even underwater)
