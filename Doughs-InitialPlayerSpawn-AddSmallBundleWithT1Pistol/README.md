**For game**: [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com)

**Description:**
This modlet adds a small box/package on initial player startup that contains a few items for a *tiny* "boost" on first spawn. It is meant for games that have more powerful zeds appearing on Day 1 (Ferals/custom zeds, or spawning not in forest biome) or games with lowered loot%.  Essentially it is to help you survive in a game with moderately decreased early difficulty so IF you run into a higher tier zed on day 1 (especially in a low tier POI) you are not just armed with a T0 weapon. This mod is not meant to make you OP or be able to take on several higher tier zeds day 1. For games with lowered loot %, it contains a little food and some super basic medical/clothing.

The package is meant to be useful only fairly early in game (open/sell within a few days).

Additionally: If you do NOT open the bundle its worth more than all the items inside it by about 20%, so you can choose to open it only if you need it, or sell it to the trader for extra $ at the trader (unopened on day 1 its worth a few boiled waters, or 10 more 9mm, or ~1/2 a cooking pot or grill). I guess you could also wait and open it "days later" once your loot stage? is higher and get a better quality pistol, or wait until you have a better selling bonus/perk but that's unlikely in early game.

This modlet adds:
- 1 Worn Boots (weather protection or scrap for cloth for bandages)
- 1 Overalls (weather protection or scrap for cloth  for bandages)
- 4 Cans of Cat Food
- 5 Potatoes (uncooked)
- 1 Sewing Kit
- 1 T1 Pistol (should be quality 1 on day 1, but maybe higher quality if open later?)
- 42 9mm rounds (almost 3 reloads)

Inspiration: There have been several "Starter Bundle/Box" mods available for awhile, but I made this one by making several modifications to one called "ServersideStarterBundle" by Cornl3read (v 1.0.0.2) which appears to be listed officially? here: https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/3183?tab=description. Usage for v.0.0.2 is shown as ok to freely modify without permission.
