**Description:**
Removes the compass points and navigational directions/ordinals from the top of the main game UI.

Why?
- Make it harder to navigate.
- It is more like people "who don't have a compass in their head" have to live their life all the time.
- Don't want to completely remove the compass: Still want the compass "window area" so you can see quest markers, if they haven't been modded out.
- Maybe someone will come up with a "compass" mod that will tell you what direction you're facing using an item or buff.
