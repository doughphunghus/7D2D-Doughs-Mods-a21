  <!-- Ran into this on forums:
  ambientInsideSpeed = 0.2 for slow transition
  ambientInsideThreshold = 0.1  so that it works so that there are fewer transitions back and forth.
  ambientInsideEquatorScale = 0.6 to reduce the difference in lighting

  <!-- How much light the moon gives off?
    do not know what the setting *is* just setting it to 1 makes indoors darker, mostly

  <!-- NOTE: Used to have this set to 2 in older version of a19 and it worked well -->
  <set xpath="/worldglobal/environment/property[@name='ambientInsideThreshold']/@value">0.1</set>

  <!-- slow transition when going inside -->
  <!-- a19,a20,a21 Default: .3 -->
  <!-- NOTE: Cannot see a difference in vanilla game? tried  0.1 -> 1 -->
  <!-- NOTE: Seting to 0.01 seems to break the effect, no dimming at all-->
  <!-- NOTE: Also Seems to work in reverse, like a light turned on in dark room takes time to light, then off taes time to dim
  also going outside takes time to brighten, in ful daylight-->
  <!-- NOTE: .1 = super slow transition, 2 = super fast.  Having it super fast screws up when you
  cross a boundary, like it goes from "I can see the entire inside of a room, to nope I cannot." -->

   it literally looks wrong, like light cannot throw shadows-->
