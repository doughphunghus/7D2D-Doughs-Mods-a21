**For game**: [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com)

**Description:**
Currently this modlet hides these "player owned" items from the compass, though you can see them as "onscreen sprites"
when you get close enough to them UNLESS you have added mods (see URL's below) to also remove the sprites.

- spear
- supply_drop
- backpack_distant
- bicycle
- minibike
- motorcycle
- gyrocopter
- junk_turret
- junk_sledge
- land_claim
- sleeping_bag

This mod is made to also be used with my "Remove the Map" mod, in order to make navigation harder.
Some things are purposefully not removed so quests and such can still be found/seen, though in theory, if removed
you could still navigate via selecting the quest and following the "distance to" info.

Original inspiration from:

Androthi/Starscreams "AND-DeclutterCompass" Mod, which already removes certain items:

Sirillion's "ZQLxNavObjects" Mod, that removes all onscreen sprites (See also a similar mod by "Wookie")

https://7daystodiemods.com/zqlxnavobjects-removes-on-screen-sprites/

Why?
- More "immersion" due to a cleaner UI
- More "immersion" as you will not have this info readily available for navigation

**Notes:**
a20 change: changing mod from "remove" the items to making them only visible from 1 block away becuase:
- Removal may affect other mods since there is no way for mods to detect if elements exist.
- Should an item be "floating above or below you" after death (for example, you die inside and backpack is on roof of POI) if you stand literally at its position it appears on the compass. It gives you "proof" the item exists but not at your elevation if you know exactly where it should be.
