**For game**: [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com)

**Description**
This modlet makes it so flashlights/lanterns are a lot harder to obtain.
Removes flashlights and flashlight related mods in loot and traders.
Parts to create flashlights are found in loot/traders but should not be common.

Adds new items (recolors of existing items) that can be found or bought from trader:
- Flashlight Case: An empty flashlight case.  Can still melee with it.
- Small Bulb: Small Halogen bulb, used for crafting flashlights.
- NevRDie Cell: Small C Cell for flashlights and lanterns.

Modifies these recipes, to require different ingredients:
- The melee flashlight
- The placeable lantern

Adds new recipes:
- Can make a car battery out of many NevRDie Cells.
- Can scrap a working flashlight for NevRDie Cells.

**Details**:
- Why? Because flashlights/place-able lantern are too OP/bright and I like a darker game. If brightness could be adjusted I would have made them easier to craft, but hard to craft a quality, bright one.  This will force you to use torches (heat sources) and/or have a harder time looting (for awhile) vs turning on your headlight all day/night.
- The new parts are not common in loot, so it should take a little while to get all the parts and craft, and by that time you should relish the fact you have anything related to a flashlight mod in your helmet/gun This also means those who loot a lot will be rewarded sooner.
