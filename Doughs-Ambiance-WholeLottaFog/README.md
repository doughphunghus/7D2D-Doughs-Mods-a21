**For game**: [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com)

**Description:**
A very thick for during day and night, kinda reminiscent of the old console look/feel. Tweaked like I personaly like it (not maximum fog though, but very visibility limiting and can be a few bloks visibility on a stormy day/night up to maybe 20? on a clear day). An easy mod to edit if you want, see the xml file in /Configs if you want to change the levels and I added some docs in there. I suspect the fog is going to be too high for a lot of people so be warned. Its supposed to encourage you to have to have a lot of lighting in your base and on you as well as make all excursions/driving very difficult.  Even riding a bicycle can be difficult at times.

This appears to be an "added additional fog" to the world/weather fog. The values I have make it so when its very foggy via the weather you will have a hard time seeing zeds until they are very close, but not on top of you. I made it foggier in the daytime, and less foggy ay night because it appears if you have the night fog too thick, it makes horde night almost impossible to see anything as horde night seems to add fog as well (or its tinting the fog red).

Also: the fog permeates all buildings/underground/etc, it doesn't just stay outdoors. I cannot stop that.
