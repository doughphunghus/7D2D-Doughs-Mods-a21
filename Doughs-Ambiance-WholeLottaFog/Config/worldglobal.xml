  <!-- The values are Day,Night 
  The numbers are not "how much fog" but more of "How much visibility"
  so a higher number is more visibility. 
  I do not know if its a percentage but that would make sense
  Vales go from 0 (no visibilty) to 1 (no fog I guess?)
  Possibly just a 2 decimal number, I have not tested more decimals
  Leading 0 is optional.
  a20: Seems like .5 is as low as you want to go to have "semi believeable" heavy fog 
  and still be able to see and react to zeds coming at you.
  a21: Maybe bump the a20 numbers down a smidge
